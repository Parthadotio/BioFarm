## 📜 Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality

## 💻 Development

### Code Style

This project uses ESLint for maintaining code quality. The configuration includes:

- React-specific rules
- Best practices enforcement
- Consistent code formatting

Run the linter:
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Hot Module Replacement

Vite provides instant HMR, making development fast and efficient. Changes to your code will be reflected immediately in the browser without losing application state.

### Plugin Options

This template uses `@vitejs/plugin-react` which uses Babel for Fast Refresh. If you need better performance, consider:

- **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)** - Uses SWC for faster compilation

To switch, install the SWC plugin and update your `vite.config.js`.

## 🏗️ Building for Production

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed to your hosting service.

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```
